# AntSimulator
## With HTML and Javascript

### Base Concept
This simulation wasn't created with the intent to be scientifically accurate, regarding how ants behave.
In this top-down mini world, ants have to collect and compete for resorces.

The main idea beyound this project is to take advantage of simple Javascript features, that allow to create complex eccosystem, and at some point turn it into a playable game, adding the possibillity of a player to set a strategy to conquest the area, agains competing Ant colonies, and other insect species.

### Current implemented features
- Set number of Ants, and number of Resources are available
- Ants can grow, and reproduce after eating X resources.
- Ants have a limited amount of life cycles, if the cycles end, the Ant despawn.
- When an Ant collect a resource, her lifecycles are increased, up to a defined maximum.
- Ants, and resources can be selected.

#### Weather effects (Wind)
- Wind, changes direction over time, and wind speed can affect Ants movement.


### Future implementations
- Add obstacles, and implement a simple obstacle avoidance logic.
- Add path following features
- Create user UI for advanced control of the simulation
